About Me

Hi! My name is Allison. I am currently a sophomore. I am interested in Biology, specifically Cancer Biology and with this in mind, I hope to pursue a career in the medical field one day. Moreover, I like to read romance and mystery novels, I also like to swim. I am also interested in Video editing and mental health. I created this Website with the main goal of showcasing things I liked to do and to create a positive mental space.
